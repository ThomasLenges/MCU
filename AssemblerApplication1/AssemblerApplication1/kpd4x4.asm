; file	kpd4x4_S.asm   target ATmega128L-4MHz-STK300		
; purpose keypad 4x4 acquisition and print
;  uses four external interrupts and ports internal pull-up

; solutions based on the methodology presented in EE208-MICRO210_ESP-2024-v1.0.fm
;>alternate solutions also possible
; standalone solution/file; not meeant as a modular solution and thus must be
;>adapted when used in a complex project
; solution based on interrupts detected on each row; not optimal but functional if
;>and external four-input gate is not available
